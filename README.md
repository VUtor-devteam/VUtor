# VUtor
Software engineering project developed by Vilnius University 2nd bachelor year students

VUtor (name pending) is a web application designed as a peer-to-peer tutoring ecosystem aimed at students from VU Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics. Its purpose is to facilitate peer tutoring and knowledge sharing by providing students with a study session matching system based on their respective profiles as well as a public library of notes, problem solutions, exam & task examples, etc., built and curated by the students, for the students.

Key features:
	1. User profile driven matchmaking;
		a. User profiles consist primarily of (but are not limited to)
			i. Information (topics) users wish to learn;
			ii. Information users know and are willing to teach.
		b. The matchmaking algorithm taking the user profiles into account attempts to find and connect the student and tutor with their respective matches.
		c. User profiles can be rated/reviewed, which aids in building a thriving and trustworthy community.
	2. Public library of shared resources;
		a. Allows users to openly browse the catalogue of information and encourages students to grow the library by adding new notes or supplementing existing ones by commenting, correcting mistakes or expanding on the information already provided.
		b. Content is divided into categories and sub-categories based on academic year, study programme, and courses;
	3. Note taking via independently developed feature or (if possible) integrated via OneNote (or alternative);
		a. Includes streamlined one click* notesharing into the public library.

Features under consideration:
	1. Announcement tab
		a. Announcements that are usually shared throughout multiple channels (is.vu, VU mail, Facebook, etc.) are collected and presented in a readable, easy to find fashion, split into categories, such as:
			i. VU Official
			ii. MIDI
			iii. Community
		Which are then split into further sub-categories, e.g. news, announcements, invitations.
	2. Study group/webinar announcement and invitation board (would most likely end up introduced alongside key feature #1)
		a. A board of planned live/digital meetings with relevant information:
			i. Time and date
			ii. Location (platform if digital)
			iii. Topics, sub-topics
			iv. Expected duration
			v. Participants
	3. Rating/review system for course difficulty and lecturers.

All in all the application would strive to create a unified tutoring and knowledge sharing ecosystem for VU MIF students, pushing out outdated alternatives like sharing notes from previous years via a Google Drive link; streamlining student-to-student connections within their respective study programmes as well as expanding their range of connections to other programmes and thus, a wide variety of knowledgable and or knowledge-seeking students in a simple, effective and easy to use manner.

*possible when the notes work within the confines of the categories and sub-categories of the library
